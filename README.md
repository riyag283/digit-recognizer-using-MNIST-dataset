# digit-recognizer-using-MNIST-dataset
Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for handwritten digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset using keras API.

The input data was divided into 90% training set and 10% validation set and the neural network was optimized using Adam Optimizer. 

The model achieved 97.43% accurary.
