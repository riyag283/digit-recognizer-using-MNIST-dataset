# digit-recognizer-using-MNIST-dataset
Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for handwritten digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset using keras API.

The input data was divided into 90%  training set and 10% validation set and the neural network was optimized using Adam Optimizer. 
tf.keras.losses. 
SparseCategoricalCrossentropy was used to compute the crossentropy loss between the labels and predictions.
The model achieved 97.43% accurary.
